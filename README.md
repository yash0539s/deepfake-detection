Introduction
DeepFake refers to AI-generated manipulated videos where a person’s face is replaced with another using deep learning models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

These videos are highly realistic, making it difficult to distinguish between real and fake content. Our project aims to detect DeepFake videos using VGG16 for feature extraction and CNN for classification.

Impact of DeepFake Videos
Negative Effects:
Misinformation and fake news are spread on social media.

Celebrity impersonation is misused for scams and fraudulent activities.

Cybersecurity threats arise due to fraudulent video content, affecting financial institutions and government agencies.

Countermeasures:
Various industries, including film, media, and security agencies, are actively developing DeepFake detection solutions to prevent fraud and misinformation.

Project Objectives
Develop an AI-powered DeepFake detection system.

Train a deep learning model to classify videos as real or fake.

Utilize VGG16 for feature extraction and CNN for classification.

Analyze manipulated frames using face landmark detection and feature extraction.

Deploy a real-time AI-based solution that can be integrated into social media platforms.

Project Pipeline
Step	Description
Step 1	Load the dataset
Step 2	Extract videos from the dataset
Step 3	Convert videos into frames (real and fake)
Step 4	Detect faces in each frame
Step 5	Extract facial landmarks
Step 6	Analyze variations in facial landmarks
Step 7	Classify videos as real or fake
Pre-processing Workflow
Convert video into frames.

Detect faces in each frame.

Resize frames to 224×224 pixels.

Normalize pixel values for deep learning training.

Extract facial landmarks to identify inconsistencies.

Prediction Workflow
Extract frames from the input video.

Detect faces using VGG16 feature extraction.

Pass extracted features through a CNN model for classification.

Aggregate frame-wise predictions to classify the entire video as real or fake.

Models Used
