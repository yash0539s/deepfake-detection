Introduction
DeepFake refers to AI-generated manipulated videos where a person’s face is replaced with another using deep learning models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

These videos are highly realistic, making it difficult to distinguish between real and fake content.

This project aims to detect DeepFake videos using VGG16 for feature extraction and CNN for classification.

Impact of DeepFake Videos
Misinformation & Fake News: Used to spread false narratives on social media.

Celebrity Impersonation: Misused for scams and fraudulent activities.

Cybersecurity Threats: Fraudulent videos pose risks to financial institutions and government agencies.

Various industries, including film, media, and security agencies, are actively developing DeepFake detection solutions.

Project Objectives
Develop an AI-powered DeepFake detection system.

Train a deep learning model to classify videos as real or fake.

Utilize VGG16 for feature extraction and CNN for classification.

Analyze manipulated frames using face landmark detection and feature extraction.

Deploy a real-time AI-based solution that can be integrated into social media platforms.

Project Pipeline
Step 1: Load the dataset

Step 2: Extract videos from the dataset

Step 3: Convert videos into frames (REAL & FAKE)

Step 4: Detect faces in each frame

Step 5: Extract facial landmarks

Step 6: Analyze variations in facial landmarks

Step 7: Classify videos as REAL or FAKE

Pre-processing Workflow
Convert video into frames.

Detect faces in each frame.

Resize frames to 224×224 pixels.

Normalize pixel values for deep learning training.

Extract facial landmarks to identify inconsistencies.

Prediction Workflow
Step 1: Extract frames from the input video.

Step 2: Detect faces using VGG16 feature extraction.

Step 3: Pass extracted features through a CNN model for classification.

Step 4: Aggregate frame-wise predictions to classify the entire video as real or fake.
