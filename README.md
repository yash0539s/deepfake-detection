📌 What is DeepFake?
🔹 DeepFake refers to AI-generated manipulated videos where a person’s face is replaced with another using advanced deep learning models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

🔹 These models create highly realistic fake videos, making it difficult to distinguish real from fake content.

⚠️ Impact of DeepFake Videos
❌ Misinformation & Fake News: Used to spread false narratives on social media.

❌ Celebrity Impersonation: DeepFake technology is misused for scams and fraudulent activities.

❌ Cybersecurity Threat: Fraudulent video content poses a risk to financial institutions and government agencies.

✅ Detection Mechanisms: Various industries, including film, media, and security agencies, are actively developing DeepFake detection solutions.

🎯 Project Objectives
✔ Develop an AI-powered DeepFake detection system.

✔ Train a robust deep learning model to classify videos as REAL or FAKE.

✔ Utilize VGG16 for feature extraction and CNN for classification.

✔ Analyze manipulated frames using face landmark detection and feature extraction.

✔ Deploy a real-time AI-based solution that can be integrated into social media platforms.

🛠 Project Pipeline
Step	Description
Step 1	Load the dataset
Step 2	Extract videos from the dataset
Step 3	Convert videos into frames (REAL & FAKE)
Step 4	Detect faces in each frame
Step 5	Extract facial landmarks
Step 6	Analyze variations in facial landmarks
Step 7	Classify videos as REAL or FAKE
🔍 Pre-processing Workflow
✅ Convert video into frames.
✅ Detect faces in each frame.
✅ Resize frames to 224×224 pixels.
